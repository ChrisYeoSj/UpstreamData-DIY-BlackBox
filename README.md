DIY Guide for an indoor BlackBox ASIC enclosure.

![](assets/TitleImage.png)

This guide will show you how to use less than $150 in commonly available materials to build an ASIC enclosure that can attenuate the noise by 20dB. The original idea for this enclosure design was put in the public domain by [Steve Barbour](https://twitter.com/SGBarbour) of [Upstream Data](https://blog.upstreamdata.ca/) around the end of August 2021 in [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1430332234951651330?s=20&t=5mmKoL9AzcqsUX-FoMzCGw). 

The original idea was for DIY enthusiasts to be able to use a single sheet of plywood, or other suitable material, to build a noise attenuating enclosure for a single new-generation ASIC or two S9 ASICs. This guide will demonstrate how to build an enclosure for indoor use.  

Here is a time-lapse video of the whole build process for you to come back to and reference.

## Step 1: Materials
The first step is to gather the materials you want. These are the materials shown in this guide, but feel free to experiment with other materials. 

Everything used for materials on this project was purchased from Home Depot for just under $150.00 USD at the time of writting, January 2022. There are a variety of materials to use for linning the inside of the enclosure. You do not need to use the materials listed here. The reasoning for these specific materials will be discussed below but feel free to experiment and find what works best for you. 

- 1 X OSB sheet, 7/16" x 48" x 96" [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/LP-OSB-7-16-in-Sheathing-Panel-Application-as-4-ft-x-8-ft-386081/202106230)
- 1 X asphalt sheet, 1/2" x 48" x 96" [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-2-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Southern-Pine-Asphalt-Impregnated-Board-A11230848096/206086210)
- 3 X Dense Shield title backer, 1/2" x 32" x 60" [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DensShield-Gypsum-Backer-Board-1-2-in-x-2-7-ft-x-5-ft-Tile-Backer-008590/100322694)
- 2 X Lumber, 2" x 3" x 96" [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-3-in-x-96-in-Select-Kiln-Dried-Whitewood-Stud-845000/100038668)
- 2 X Liquid Nails adhesive [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Liquid-Nails-10-oz-Heavy-Duty-Construction-Adhesive-LN-903/100176209)
- 1 X Roll of foil duct tape [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Nashua-Tape-2-5-in-x-60-yd-324A-Premium-Foil-HVAC-UL-Listed-Duct-Tape-1542698/100048600)
- 1 X Vent register, 4" x 10" [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-4-in-x-10-in-2-Way-Steel-Floor-Register-in-White-E150MW-04X10/300539127)
- 1 X Box of long screws [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Grip-Rite-9-x-3-in-Philips-Bugle-Head-Coarse-Thread-Sharp-Point-Polymer-Coated-Exterior-Screw-1-lb-Pack-PTN3S1/100115639)
- 1 X Box of short screws [example](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Grip-Rite-8-x-1-1-4-in-Star-Drive-Bugle-Head-Construction-Screw-1-lb-Pack-114GCS1/204982239)

The OSB was used because it is easy to work with, relatively cheap, and widely available. OSB is not fire rated however, consider using a different material if this is a concern.

The asphalt board was used because it is good at noise absorption.

The Dense Shield backer board was used becuase it is a heavy dense material good for blocking noise.

Consider using different materials if you have ideas you want to try out.

## Step 2: Tools
Once you have the materials, you will need some tools to work with those materials. Here is a list of tools used in this guide:

- Chop saw
- Skill saw
- Table saw
- Air compressor
- Impact drill
- Tape measure
- Level
- Caulking gun
- Grinder
- Clamps

Consider getting at least these tools before starting your project.

## Step 3: Preparation

![](assets/darwing00.png)

This is the drawing that was used to prepare the OSB, asphalt board, and Dense Shield. All pieces were first cut to these rough dimensions. Depending on the materials you decide to use for linning your enclosure, the final dimensions may vary. Starting with these rough dimensions is recommended, then during the assembly process you will be able to cut down pieces to be the correct size accordingly. 

For example, the final exterior dimensions of the enclosure are 32" H x 32" L x 16" W. However, the dimensions of the interior pieces were only 13-1/2" wide becuase of the space taken up by the linning materials. The dimensions of the pieces you use on the interrior of your enclosure will be determined by the thickness of the linning materials you have selected. 

The OSB, asphalt board, and Dense Shield were all cut to the sizes of the pieces in the drawing above. 

## Step 4: Assemble the frame
Once all the pieces are cut to the rough sizes, start with the bottom piece of OSB, 16" x 32". Cut 4 pieces of lumber at 31-1/2" to make the corners. Then drive a screw into each piece of lumber, aligning it with the corner of the base.
